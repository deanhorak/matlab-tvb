MATLAB interface to TVB
-----------------------

This is an interface to TVB. Please add this folder to your MATLAB path
and then work through vb_test.m (preferably with MATLAB Editor's 
cell mode), to see how it should work and to test your own installation.

In principle, this should work from any recent MATLAB, interacting with
the standard distribution of TVB. 

Currently, data is saved somewhere on the local computer, so this interface
won't work over a network, but this would be possible in the future.
